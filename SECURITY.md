## 🛡️ Security Best Practices & Automated Scanning

Security and code integrity are enforced continuously through our automated pipeline and **Makefile** tooling:

1. **Automated Secret Detection (`make check`)**:
   - `detect-secrets` runs locally via pre-commit hooks before every commit.
   - Prevents accidental exposure of API keys, tokens, or private credentials.

2. **Static Security Analysis (`make audit`)**:
   - Bandit AST security scanning detects common Python vulnerabilities, unsafe des-serialization, and shell injection risks.

3. **Safe File I/O & Parameter Validation**:
   - CLI scripts sanitize dataset paths and user mileage input.
   - `thetas.json` is read and written using safe JSON serialization (avoiding `pickle` or `eval`).
   - Gracefully handle exceptions without leaking raw stack traces or internal environment variables.

4. **Dependency Vulnerability Management**:
   - Dependabot regularly scans and submits automated PRs for Python dependencies (`pip`) and GitHub Actions.

5. **Environment Isolation**:
   - Always run the project inside an isolated virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
   - Avoid executing analytical scripts with elevated (root/sudo) privileges.
